This is a quick demo with vertical planes "tracking" derived from my other demo (arkit-occlusion-demo). It allows you to draw graffity on the walls/vertical planes. Features:
- map walls (so they are tracked relative to floor)
- draw simple decals on each tracked walls (using SpriteKit!)
- vary decal size by distance to walls
- allow you to pick from different colors to paint in

This requires, Xcode 9, iOS 11 and a relatively recent iOS device.

You can pretty much do want you want with the code, but please provide attribution, also if you use it to create a video.

Hey! If you go paint a moustache on some famous painting in a musuem, please shoot a video (use iOS 11 screen recording) and send it (link) to me :)
